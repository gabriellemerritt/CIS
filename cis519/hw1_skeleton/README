# README FILE
# Introduction to Machine Learning
# Assignment 1
#
# After completing the assignment, fill in this README file.  It asks you to duplicate
# your answer to several questions.  Be certain that your answers in this README file
# (which will be used for auto-grading) match the answers in your PDF writeup.
#
# This README file is formatted in YAML to allow it to be machine readable.  Please
# be very careful with how you edit it, being careful to following the formatting.
# Make certain not to change any text in all UPPERCASE.  After editing, you can make 
# certain that your README file follows proper YAML syntax by running it through an
# online YAML checker, such as http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
# 
# The most frequent error is multi-line strings, such as "SOURCESCONSULTED" and 
# "FEEDBACK_ERRORS".  Make certain that the previous line ends with a | followed by a 
# newline.  Then, make certain that the subsequent lines are indented one level in 
# (4 spaces).  This sounds complex, but just follow the existing format of this file.
# If you run into any problems that you can't fix easily in listing your sources or 
# providing feedback on the assignment, just include your multi-line string answers to
# these parts as comments.  Everything else (all simple one-word or numeric answers) must
# be properly formatted YAML.

SOURCESCONSULTED: |
    While completing the assignment, I consulted the following sources: 
    Asked roommate about x_0, realized it was a vector and not a single value of
    x at 0. 
    Dean helped me understand for cross validation you train and test on
    k% of the folds before you reshuffle

# Answer to Implementation Exercise 1.5:  Closed form of linear regression
#######################################################################################

# Copy and paste your one-line matrix equation for computing the closed form solution
# to linear regression (e.g., Line 171 of test_linreg_univariate.py or Line 51 of 
# test_linreg_multivariate.py)

# Answer to Implementation Exercise 2.3:  Analysis of the regularization parameter
#######################################################################################

# Copy and paste your brief paragraph describing the effect of the regularization 
# parameter from your PDF.
LOGREGIMPLEMENTATION_REGULARIZATION_ANALYSIS: |
    For my varied values of lambda I noticed that the larger lambda became the faster old  
    theta and new theta converged, and in cases for large lambdas ,the worse the  
    classifier worked. For small values of lambda the slower the gradient decent, without 
    much gain.

FEEDBACK_PROBLEMS: |
    I had a lot of problems dealing with arrays and matrices and what python returns. Also                       
    the plotting errors set me back for awhile until I checked Piazza.
